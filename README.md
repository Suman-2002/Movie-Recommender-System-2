# Movie-Recommender-System-2
 
I made a content-based movie recommender system using some of the machine learning algorithms and python programming language.I took the help of IDEs such as Jupyter and Pycharm and used Heroku for deployment.I made the project by using a dataset of 5000 movies from TMDB website.Thus,the user needs to select a movie from the available options and the recommender system would then show the similar movies.
